# Exploratory Data Analysis for Hotel Demand Prediction

## Introduction
In this notebook, we will conduct a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the hotel demand prediction project. The goal is to understand the dataset better and extract meaningful insights that can help in building a predictive model.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of hotel booking information, including various features such as arrival date, number of guests, length of stay, and booking status. 

### Importing Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

### Loading the Data
```python
df = pd.read_csv('hotel_bookings.csv')
```

### Initial Data Exploration
Let's take a look at the first few rows of the dataset:
```python
df.head()
```

### Data Types and Missing Values
We need to check the data types and any missing values in the dataset.
```python
print(df.info())
print(df.isnull().sum())
```

### Basic Statistics
Obtaining basic statistics for numerical features:
```python
print(df.describe())
```

## Univariate Analysis
### Distribution of Key Features
We will analyze the distribution of key features such as lead time, number of special requests, and total price.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.histplot(df['lead_time'], bins=30, kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Lead Time')
plt.show()
```

## Bivariate Analysis
### Relationship Between Features
Investigating the relationship between lead time and booking status:
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.boxplot(x='is_canceled', y='lead_time', data=df)
plt.title('Lead Time vs Booking Status')
plt.show()
```

### Correlation Matrix
Let's visualize the correlation between numerical features:
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, fmt='.2f', cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
plt.show()
```

## Conclusion
In this notebook, we performed a comprehensive exploratory data analysis of the hotel demand dataset. We visualized key features, examined relationships, and identified potential predictors for our demand prediction model. Further steps will include feature engineering and model development.
